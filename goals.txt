Multi-View Consistent Generative Adversarial Networks for 3D-aware Image Synthesis

https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.06307

We want to reproduce the minimum FID score (11.8) for 256*256 CELEBA-HQ dataset as it was specified in table 1 

—— version 1 submission ——

We update our goal as reaching to 256x256 training stage on our training loop and minimize FID score as much as we can. 
We now see that our goal has been set as too high as training MVCGAN requires 42 V100 GPU days [1]. We neither have the time
or budget to train the model for that long. 

So far we have trained the model on an A100 GPU using Paperspace Gradient. Traning for this much costs us $30.65. Our best FID score is 72.9 and we intend to keep on training
as long as our budget allows.
